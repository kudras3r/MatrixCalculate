## Roadmap

- First note in log - **07.12.23** at this moment it is only 3x3 matrixes adding mode. 

- First commit on GitHub - **10.12.23**

- Initially it was planned to carry out calculations using C++, but later the library was chosen _numpy_ - **18.12.23** using _numpy_ for the first time. In addition, a class buffer for data exchange appeared.

- Adding a mode for working with one matrix and _.env_ file for app security. Adding new features for working with matrices - **24.12.23**

- Working on registering and connecting the database - from **26.12.23** to **30.12.23**

- WORK! - from **31.12.23** to **eternity**
